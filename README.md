### Alignment of Organizations with Your Interests

| Organization  | Alignment Details  |
|---------------|--------------------|
| CSA           | Aligns best with my interest in cloud security as it focuses on securing cloud computing environments. |
| CISO Executive Network | Not aligned with my current role or experience in the security industry, as it's catered toward security executives. |
